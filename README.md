# Project Overview

This project is a React app which displays details for a list of products, such as product id number, product name, amount in inventory, etc. The app will calculate the delivery date of each product based on a maximum number of shipping days, and a flag indicating whether the product ships on weekends or just business days.

## Screenshots
